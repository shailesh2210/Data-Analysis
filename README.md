## Introduction

In this data analysis project, we analyze a dataset to gain insights and answer specific questions. The project demonstrates how to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using Python. It also showcases the usage of popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x: The project is implemented in Python, so you need to have Python installed. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

## Installation

To use this project, you can either clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

To clone the repository, open a terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-project.git
```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd data-analysis-project
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform data analysis on the provided dataset.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
data-analysis-project/
├── data/
│   ├── dataset.csv
├── notebooks/
│   └── data_analysis.ipynb
├── README.md
```

- The `data` directory contains the dataset (`dataset.csv`) that will be used for analysis.

- The `notebooks` directory contains the Jupyter Notebook (`data_analysis.ipynb`) where the data analysis is performed.

- The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.
